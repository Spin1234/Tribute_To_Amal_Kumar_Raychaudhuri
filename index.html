          Amal Kumar Raychaudhuri (14 September 1923 – 18 June 2005) was an
          Indian physicist, known for his research in general relativity and
          cosmology. His most significant contribution is the eponymous
          Raychaudhuri equation, which demonstrates that singularities arise
          inevitably in general relativity and is a key ingredient in the proofs
          of the Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems. Raychaudhuri was also
          revered as a teacher during his tenure at Presidency College, Kolkata.

      <div class="career" style="padding: 35px 60px 0px">
        <h2>Career</h2>
        <ul style="list-style: none">
          <li>
            Raychaudhuri was born in a Baidya family coming from Barisal (now in
            Bangladesh) on 14 September 1923, to Surabala and Sureshchandra
            Raychaudhuri. He was just a child when the family migrated to
            Kolkata. He had his early education in Tirthapati Institution and
            later completed matriculation from Hindu School, Kolkata. In a
            documentary film made just before his death in 2005, AKR reveals
            that he was extremely passionate about mathematics right from his
            schooldays and solving problems would give him immense pleasure. He
            recalls in the documentary how his grade 9th teacher credited him
            for discovering a simpler solution for a mathematics problem. May be
            the fact that his father was a mathematics teacher in a school also
            inspired him. At the same time, as his father was not so
            'successful' so to say, he was discouraged to take up mathematics,
            his first choice, as honours subject in college.
          </li>
          <li>
            He earned B.Sc. from the Presidency College in 1942 and M.Sc. in
            1944 from Science College campus of Calcutta University and he
            joined Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS) in
            1945 as a research scholar. In 1952, he took a research job with the
            Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), but to his
            frustration was required to work on the properties of metals rather
            than general relativity. Despite these adverse pressures, he was
            able to derive and publish the equation which is now named for him a
            few years later. Raychaudhuri equation is a key ingredient in the
            proofs of the Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some years later, having learned that his 1955 paper was highly
            regarded by notable physicists, such as Pascual Jordan, Raychaudhuri
            was sufficiently emboldened to submit a doctoral dissertation, and
            received his Doctor of Science degree at the University of Calcutta
            (with one of the examiners, Prof John Archibald Wheeler recording
            special appreciation of the work done) in 1959.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1961, Raychaudhuri joined the faculty of his alma mater,
            Presidency College then affiliated with the University of Calcutta,
            and remained there until his superannuation. He became a well-known
            scientific figure in the 1970s, and was the subject of a short
            documentary film completed shortly before his death.

        <ul style="list-style: none">
          <h2>Report</h2>
          <li>
            In general relativity, the Raychaudhuri equation plays a significant
            role to explain the space-time singularities and gravitational
            focusing properties in cosmology. He aimed to address the
            fundamental question of singularity in the most simple and general
            form with no reference to any symmetry and any specific property of
            space-time and energy distribution.
          </li>
          <li>
            The first mention of the term'Raychaudhuri Equation' appeared in a
            research paper published in 1965 by George F.R. Ellis and Stephen
            Hawking. The Raychaudhuri equation[12] hit the zenith of fame as it
            was a key tool in the hands of young relativists like Stephen
            Hawking and Roger Penrose in the middle of the late 1960s in their
            attempt to answer the question on the existence of space-time
            singularities and to explain the theory of universe. In fact, this
            equation is important as a fundamental lemma for the Penrose-Hawking
            singularity theorems.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is such wide acceptability of this equation like other notable
            equations in physics like 'the Dirac equation and Schroedinger
            equation' that nobody cares about its origin or date of publication.
            The Raychaudhuri equation paved the way for later research into the
            singularity problem. It would find its place in venerable textbooks
            on general relativity and relativistic cosmology. The equation will
            stand firm so long Einstein's GTR stands. The equation remains a
            prime tool to investigate the behaviour of black hole horizons. One
            would wonder if there is any research work of such grade to have
            emerged in post-independent India.
